# CSS Experiments

### CSS property display:flex

Basic usage: Flex, a.k.a. flexible box, or flexbox, is a newer way to control layouts used in more [recent browsers](http://caniuse.com/#feat=flexbox). It's a great enhancement for [divs](https://www.sitepoint.com/community/t/div-background-color/6709), which are used to control webpage flow layout in the form of blocks. Previously before flex, people hardcoded with [absolute pixel positions](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5161046/html-div-positions-and-display), this wasn't scalable.  Now with flex, minimum heights and widths can be specified, making it much easier.
